  According to latest Review of Particle Physics (RPP) by Particle Data Group (PDG), the spin-parity of excited open-charm mesons 
  <i>D(2550), D<sub>J</sub>(2600), D(2640), D(2740), D<sub>3</sub>(2750), D<sub>J</sub>(3000), D<sub>J</sub>(3000), D<sub>2</sub>(3000), 
  D<sub>s1</sub>(2536), D<sub>s1</sub>(2860), D<sub>s3</sub>(2860)</i> and <i>D<sub>sJ</sub>(3040)<i> are not yet confirmed from the known experimental 
  measurements. It is crucial to assign the spin-parity of hadrons which facilitate the determination of properties such as decay width, branching 
  fraction, isospin mass splitting, polarization amplitude, etc. Theoretically, there is much possible interpretation of these open-charm mesons. 
  Here we apply the heavy quark effective theory (HQET) in the leading order approximation to calculate the strong decay of experimentally seen 
  open-charm mesons. The ratio of the branching fraction measurement of strong decay modes can help to classify the decaying meson. Experimental 
  information in the bottom sector is limited. Due to large non-resonant continuum contributions, however, experimentally the broad resonance states 
  are difficult to identify. We shall calculate the masses and strong decay behavior of excited bottom mesons in the framework of HQET. The flavor 
  symmetry of heavy quark explore the flavor independent parameters <i>Δ<sub>F</sub><sup>(c)</sup>= Δ<sub>F</sub><sup>(b)</sup></i> and 
  <i>λ<sub>F</sub><sup>(c)</sup> = λ<sub>F</sub><sup>(b)</sup></i> to calculate the masses of excited open-bottom mesons. This study may raise many 
  possibilities in the decisions of the experimentally missing open-bottom mesons. Additionally, our spin-parity assignment 
  of experimentally observed open-charm mesons may allow us to construct the Regge trajectories in <i>(M<sup>2</sup>,J)</i> and <i>(M<sup>2</sup>,n<sub>r</sub>)</i>
  planes, where <i>J</i> is the total-spin, <i>n<sub>r</sub></i> is the radial principal quantum number, and M<sup>2</sup> is the square of the meson mass. 
  That can estimate the masses of experimentally missing states lying on these Regge lines. Their ratio of the strong decay rates may guide 
  future experimental studies to find them in fundamental decay modes. <p>
