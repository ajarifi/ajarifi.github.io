  We study the $\Omega(2012)$ which was measured in the Belle experiment. 
  We conduct a study of the interaction of the $\bar{K}\Xi^\ast$, \eta\Omega(s-wave) and $\bar{K}\Xi$(d-wave) channels 
  within a coupled channel unitary approach. We find that all data including the Belle experiment on 
  $\Gamma(\Omega^\ast\rightarrow\pi\bar{K}\Xi)/\Gamma(\Omega^\ast\rightarrow\bar{K}\Xi)$ are compatible with the molecular 
  picture stemming from meson baryon interaction of these channels. In this talk, I report the results based on Ref. [1].
