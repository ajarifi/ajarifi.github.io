  To probe point-like particles inside nucleon, an incident lepton with extremely high energy is required. 
  It can be described by the fast-moving target frame, namely the infinite momentum frame. 
  Since the equivalence between the infinite momentum frame and light-front dynamics is well known, 
  the light-front dynamics play a significant role in understanding the hadron structure. 
  Especially, the twist expansion is well defined on the light-front coordinates, 
  and light-front time-ordered amplitudes are invariant under the z-direction Lorentz boost, 
  which provides the Fock space expansion with a trivial vacuum.

In this talk, we show the basic formulation of light-front field theory and discuss 
  elastic scattering and virtual meson production using the light-front quark model 
  in a scalar field theory. From each process, we can obtain the electromagnetic form factor
  and Compton form factor. In addition, we can investigate the deeply virtual scattering 
  using the leading twist, it provides consistent results and the sum rules between the 
  generalized parton distribution, parton distribution function, and electromagnetic form factor.
