  In this talk, we will first briefly review the mechanism of the triangle singularity in hadronic scattering processes. 
  Then, the resonance of the $N^∗(1875)(3/2^-)$ with a coupled-channel unitary approach is studied by considering 
  the $\Delta\pi$ and $\Sigma^* K$, with their interaction extracted from chiral Lagrangians. In addition, two more channels, 
  the $N^∗(1535)\pi$ and $N\sigma$ are taken into account via triangle diagrams involving the  $\Sigma^* K$ and $\Delta\pi$ 
  respectively in the intermediate states. As results, the triangle diagram in the $N^*(1535)\pi$ case develops a singularity 
  at the same energy as the resonance mass. We determined the couplings of the resonance to the different channels and the 
  partial decay widths. We found a very large decay width to $\Sigma^* K$ and observed that, due to interference with other terms, 
  the Nσ channel has an important role in the ππ mass distributions at low invariant masses, leading to an apparently large $N\sigma$ decay width. 
  Finally, we discuss justifying the convenience of an experimental reanalysis of this resonance using coupled-channel unitary schemes.
