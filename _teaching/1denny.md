<p align="justify">Motivated by the amount of recent observations of new hadron phenomena, such as the <i>XYZ</i> states,  we propose a deep learning method to analyze the origin of enhancement in the two-particle scattering cross-sections. The method identifies the pole configuration of a coupled channel scattering amplitude, namely the number of poles in each Riemann sheet. The teaching dataset is generated by a generic parametrized S-matrix with controlled pole configurations. To accelerate the training process with acceptable accuracy of the program, we employ the curriculum learning algorithm.  We also introduce a systematic way to handle the experimental error bars. For a specific demonstration, we apply the present method to the <i>πN</i> scattering amplitude with <i>I(J<sup>P</sup>)=1/2(1/2<sup>-</sup>)</i>. We find that the enhancement seen around the <i>ηN</i> threshold is caused by at most two poles in the distant Riemann sheet. Our approach can be applied to various problems of classifying observed peaks especially near thresholds, providing a model independent analysis tool to the conventional model-fitting scheme.</p>
