  Chiral symmetry is one of the most important symmetries in QCD. 
  In fact, the symmetry enables us to understand the properties (mass spectrum, decay width, etc.) 
  of hadrons having light quarks in a field-theoretically systematic way.
  In this talk, I review recent development of study of heavy hadrons from the chiral models, 
  showing comparisons with the quark model investigations.
  Besides, I explain my recent research on the Roper-like singly heavy 
  baryons from a chiral model approach.
