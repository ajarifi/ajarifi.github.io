My research interest is primarily focused on the study of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and its application to hadron physics. 
QCD is the fundamental theory of the strong interaction that describes the behavior of quarks and gluons, 
the elementary constituents of hadrons such as protons and neutrons. 
Our goal is to deepen our understanding on the properties and behavior of these strongly interacting particles, 
including their spectroscopy, structure, and interactions in matter. 
My research focuses on developing theoretical models to investigate various aspects of hadron physics, 
and to test and validate these models against experimental data and lattice QCD simulation. 
This includes the use of effective Lagrangian models, chiral quark models, light-front quark models, 
and other theoretical frameworks to study the properties of hadrons. </p>

<h2 style="color:#900C3F"> Hardron structure </h2>

<p align="justify"> 
One of my research intersts is in the field of hadron physics on the light front. 
The light front is a unique reference frame for studying the dynamics of hadrons, 
where the front of light cone is used as the hyperplane to describe the hadron's momentum. 
This framework has become increasingly important in recent years, as it provides a natural 
way to describe the internal structure of hadrons in a relativistic framework.
My work in this field is focused on using the light-front quark model (LFQM) to study 
the phenomenology of hadron spectroscopy and structure. By analyzing the mass spectra 
and wave functions of hadron, we can gain a deeper understanding of the 
dynamics of quarks and gluons within these particles. Additionally, we explore the impact 
of different model parameters and compare the results with experimental data, in order to 
refine the theoretical framework and improve our understanding of hadron physics. </p>

<h2 style="color:#900C3F"> Hardron production and decays </h2>

<p align="justify"> 
My research focus is on understanding the dynamics of hadronic resonances through their production
in scattering and multi-body decay processes. Hadron resonances are typically produced through scattering processes
utilizing various probes such as meson or photon beam, but in recent years, there has been a growing interest
in analyzing multi-body decays of heavy particles to study hadron resonances. 
The Dalitz plot analysis has become a promising tool for this purpose and was used in the discovery of the $P_c$ pentaquark. 
However, the analysis of multi-body decay requires a careful approach such as coupled channel amplitude analysis. 
As a result, it has become a crucial and active area of research in the field of hadron spectroscopy, 
with promising prospects for the discovery of new hadron resonances in various experimental facilities. </p>

<h2 style="color:#900C3F"> Hardron in nuclear matter</h2>
My research interest lies in exploring the intricate dynamics of quark-meson coupling within nuclear matter 
and its implications for hadron behavior. Utilizing theoretical frameworks such as effective field theories 
and lattice QCD simulations, I aim to model the microscopic interactions between quarks and mesons in dense nuclear environments, 
shedding light on phenomena like quark confinement and chiral symmetry breaking. 
By integrating theoretical predictions with experimental observations from nuclear reactions, 
deep inelastic scattering, and heavy-ion collisions, I seek to deepen our understanding of the fundamental 
forces governing hadron properties in complex nuclear settings. Ultimately, my research endeavors to unravel the 
underlying mechanisms shaping the behavior of subatomic particles within the intricate landscape of nuclear matter.

<h2 style="color:#900C3F"> Few-body problems in hadrons </h2>
My research interest is focused on elucidating few-body problems within hadronic systems, 
particularly employing the Gaussian expansion method. 
By leveraging this computational technique, I aim to dissect the intricate interplay of constituent quarks and gluons within hadrons, 
unraveling their collective behavior and dynamic interactions. Through theoretical modeling and numerical simulations, 
I seek to elucidate the underlying structure and properties of hadronic systems, including exotic states and resonances, 
shedding light on their emergence and manifestation in experimental observations. Additionally, I aim to explore the implications 
of few-body dynamics in hadrons for understanding fundamental aspects of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and its role 
in shaping the properties of strongly interacting particles. Ultimately, my research endeavors to advance our comprehension 
of the intricate dynamics governing hadronic systems and their relevance in the broader context of subatomic physics.
