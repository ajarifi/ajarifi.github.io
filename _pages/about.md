<h2 style="color:#000080">  Personal </h2>

<p align="justify"> Greetings! I am a theoretical physicist with expertise in nuclear hadron physics. I earned my undergraduate degree in the physics department of Universitas Indonesia, working under the guidance of Prof. Terry Mart. Subsequently, I moved to Osaka University to pursue a Ph.D. in physics, where I had the privilege of working with Prof. Atsushi Hosaka to study heavy baryon decays in the quark model. I also had the opportunity to complete an internship at JAEA for six months to work with Belle experimentalists. Though my graduation coincided with the Covid-19 pandemic, I was fortunate enough to secure a position at APCTP, where I currently work. At APCTP, I have been conducting research on the light-front quark model, with the guidance of Prof. Chueng-Ryong Ji and other professors. </p>

<h2 style="color:#000080">  My research </h2>

<p align="justify"> 
My research is mainly focused on hadron physics, with a particular interest in hadron spectroscopy, reactions, and structure, as well as hadrons in matter. I have experience using various models, such as the effective Lagrangian approach, chiral quark model, light-front quark model, and quark-meson coupling (QMC) model. One of my main areas of interest is the Dalitz plot analysis, which I have employed to investigate hadron resonances. Furthermore, I am intrigued by the light-front quark model, which provides a relativistic approach to studying hadron structure. As a lifelong learner, I am always eager to acquire new knowledge and expand my research interests in the vast field of hadron physics.
