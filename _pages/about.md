<h2 style="color:#000080">  Personal </h2>

<p align="justify"> 
Greetings! I am a theoretical physicist with expertise in nuclear hadron physics. I earned my undergraduate degree in the physics department of the University of Indonesia, working under the guidance of Prof. Terry Mart. Subsequently, I moved to Osaka to pursue a Ph.D. in physics, where I had the privilege of working with Prof. Atsushi Hosaka to study heavy baryon decays in the quark model. I also had the opportunity to complete an internship at JAEA for six months to work with Belle experimentalists. Though my graduation coincided with the Covid-19 pandemic, I was fortunate enough to secure a position at APCTP, where I currently work. At APCTP, I have been conducting research on a light-front quark model, with the guidance of Prof. Chueng-Ryong Ji and other professors.

<h2 style="color:#000080">  My research </h2>

<p align="justify"> My research focuses on hadron spectroscopy and decay. At the very beginning, I analyzed the kaon photoproduction in the isobar model. After that, my interest turns into the baryon decays in the quark model. I am also specialized in the Dalitz plot analysis to describe three-body decays. So far, we focus only on heavy baryons, but we can extend our work to other systems. In addition, I am recently interested in the Roper resonance and its analogous states that bear similarities in masses and decay properties. </p>
