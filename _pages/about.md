<p align="justify"> 
 I was born in Bekasi, Indonesia, in December 1993. I spent my undergraduate study in physics department, University Indonesia. After that, I moved to Osaka to pursue my graduate study in theoretical physics. I mainly worked with <a href="https://inspirehep.net/authors/1005542?ui-citation-summary=true">Prof. Atsushi Hosaka</a> during my stay in RCNP, Japan. We have discovered many exciting results on heavy baryon decays. I had also an opportunity to do an internship in <a href="https://asrc.jaea.go.jp/soshiki/gr/atp/index.html">JAEA</a> for half year. Unfortunately, I graduated in Covid-19 Pandemics, but I managed to find a job in APCTP, Korea, which is my current position. </p>
<p align="justify"> I enjoy traveling, playing video games, badminton, football and podcast.</p>

<h2 style="color:#000080">  My research </h2>

<p align="justify"> My research focuses on hadron spectroscopy. At the very beginning, I did some computation on the kaon photoproduction. Now, I have done numerous computation on heavy baryon decays. I am mainly working on three-body decays by using Dalitz plot. Also, I do some quark model computations for estimating the decay rates of heavy baryons. </p>
