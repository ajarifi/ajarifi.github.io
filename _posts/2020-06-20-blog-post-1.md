<p align="justify"> <strong>(June 21, 2021)</strong> <i> This blog is a repost from Interaction.org. I only include this temporarily for the blog template. Most of the projects with which I have ever been substantially involved have been concerned with fundamental research.  Fundamental research is typically interested in exploring ideas on the very edge of human knowledge, attempting to broaden our understanding of the basic principles of matter and the universe so that we can develop new models that allow us to fathom undiscovered depths.  </i></p>

<p align="justify"> <span style="font-size: 35px; line-height: 70px;">F</span>undamental research is exciting because it often leads in unexpected directions, revealing something not originally sought or paving the way for new fields and technologies.  It’s not like applied research where an application has already been determined and you’re working toward a specific end.  There’s no predetermined application in mind for fundamental research, and so sometimes it can be referred to as blue-sky research.  I like that term because I can imagine a researcher staring up into the clear, blue sky, pondering the universe and waiting for inspiration to strike.  It struck Newton in the form of an apple.  It struck the dinosaurs in the form of an asteroid.  (But that’s not relevant to this discussion).</p>

<p align="justify">I love being involved in fundamental research and I take great joy in sharing that excitement with others through presentations, talks, and not letting people off the elevator until they show the appropriate level of enthusiasm for what I’m unintentionally shouting about.  And as excited (and dangerously animated) as I get when talking about the details, like the role nuclear physics plays in the search for dark matter or how capturing the signature of neutrinoless double-beta decay can explain certain mysteries about the Big Bang, people still have the gall to ask me such mood-killing questions as “How will this research be useful  in the real world?”  The nerve.</p>

<p align="justify"> But it’s a perfectly valid question.  Why do we do fundamental research?  Why should we do fundamental research?  When there are so many big problems that need to be solved, is it a waste of time conducting research with no immediate application?  And in a world where most fundamental research is funded by government, why should taxpayers pay for it?</p>

<p align="justify">There are a lot of great answers to those questions ranging from the personal to the societal.  It’s a popular topic for articles, papers, and economic research.  If you were to ask me personally why I have chosen to engage in fundamental research, I would have trouble picking which answer to give you.  I could give you “Because it’s exciting to be on the frontier of human knowledge!” or maybe “Because it’s deeply fulfilling to watch a theory come together and change the way we view the world around us.”  I might even tell you “I do it to take a peek behind the curtain and hear the poetry of the universe, man”, but I need to be holding a tambourine to really make that one work.  But let us step back from me and take a look at the big picture first and talk about why it make sense on the large scale to do fundamental research at all.  The truth is that fundamental research is a fantastically positive investment of time and money.</p>

<p align="justify">First of all, the most obvious benefit of fundamental research is that it provides us with the knowledge we need to build the technologies of tomorrow.  It may be difficult to understand how our research into, for instance, neutrinos, ghostly particles that pass through normal matter, could ever be used for any form of technology.  However, scientists conducting fundamental research in the past couldn’t imagine the absolutely world-changing technologies that would one day be based on their work, either.  Without work to discover and understand the electron, electric fields, radio waves, and electromagnetism - all work done in the realm of fundamental research - we would not have the world we do today.  We would not only be missing our precious cell phones, computers, and cars, but the world would never have come to know, love, and eventually turn its back on Big Mouth Billy Bass.  So what technologies could come out of the fundamental research of today?  Neutrino radios capable of transmitting through any object, even the entire Earth?  Gravity wave engines capable of propelling a starship through the depths of space?  Dark Matter energy generators that require no fuel?  The truth is, we don’t know.  These are imaginary possibilities, but the reality will undoubtedly be more fantastic.</p>
