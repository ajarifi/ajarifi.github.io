Three-body decay of charmed baryons Λc(2595) and Λc(2625) into Λcππ are studied with effective Lagrangians in which 
the coupling constants are extracted from the nonrelativistic quark model. We take into account sequential processes 
going through  Σc(2455) and Σ∗c(2520) in intermediate states. The total decay widths are sensitive to the coupling 
of Λc with Σcπ open channel and to Σ*cπ closed channel. We find that Λc(2595) and Λc(2625) with λ mode assignment 
can explain the experimental data nicely. We also show invariant mass distributions of Λc(2595) and Λc(2625) decays, 
which are significantly different for various quark configurations.
