<p align="justify"> We compare two different propagator and vertex factor formulations of spin-3/2 and -5/2 nucleon resonances by using isobar models for kaon photoproduction on the proton γ+p→K+Λ. All nucleon resonances listed in the Particle Data Group listing with spin up to 5/2 and with at least a two-star rating are included in the model. The unknown coupling constants are extracted from fitting to around 7400 data points. It is found that the gauge-invariant formulation of the spin-3/2 and −5/2 interactions leads to a better agreement with experimental data. An extensive comparison of model calculation with experimental data and comparison with the previous analyses are presented. A short discussion on the cross section near the production threshold is also provided.</p>
