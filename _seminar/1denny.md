<p align="justify"> The Roper resonance N(1440) has been a mysterious state in hadron physics for almost 60 years because of its incompatibility with the conventional quark model. In recent years, the candidates of Roper-like state in heavy baryon sectors, e.g., Λ𝑐(2765)and Λ𝑏(6072), have been observed in experiments although their spin and parity are not directly measured. Interestingly, they share not only similar excitation energies but also decay properties, that may provide a new aspect of the Roper resonance. In this work, we focus on investigating the decay properties of Roper-like heavy baryons. In particular, we show how their two-pion emission decay can be helpful to determine their spin and parity. The experimental confirmation is required to further establish the existence of the Roper-like states. Such measurements can be principally done in the current experimental facilities such as LHC and B-factory experiments.</p>
