<b>Abstract</b>:
<p align="justify"> The Roper resonance N(1440) has been a mysterious state in hadron physics for almost 60 years because of its incompatibility with the conventional quark model. In recent years, the candidates of Roper-like state in heavy baryon sectors, e.g., Œõùëê(2765)and Œõùëè(6072), have been observed in experiments although their spin and parity are not directly measured. Interestingly, they share not only similar excitation energies but also decay properties, that may provide a new aspect of the Roper resonance. In this work, we focus on investigating the decay properties of Roper-like heavy baryons. In particular, we show how their two-pion emission decay can be helpful to determine their spin and parity. The experimental confirmation is required to further establish the existence of the Roper-like states. Such measurements can be principally done in the current experimental facilities such as LHC and B-factory experiments.</p>
